# Catalogue Scoring

## Created by: Aaditya Mahesh Patil

#### Team: Oceanflow 🌊

Welcome to **CatalogIQ**! This project addresses a critical problem in decentralized e-commerce networks: the scoring of catalogues to ensure a seamless user experience and optimal sales performance.

### 🌟 Why Scoring Catalogues Matters

In decentralized e-commerce networks, consumer-end applications often receive unsophisticated catalogues, leading to a poor user experience and a significant loss in sales. Since these consumer-end applications do not have a direct connection with the seller-side applications, it's essential to score the catalogues within the network. This scoring mechanism helps maintain a high-quality user experience across all platforms by ensuring that catalogues are sophisticated and user-friendly.

### 🚀 Solution Overview

CatalogIQ provides a robust scoring mechanism for catalogues using an API. This solution ensures that all catalogues within the decentralized network are scored effectively, based on Compliance, Correctness & Completeness, maintaining a high standard of quality and enhancing the overall user experience.
